# Example: Google Vertex AI Configuration
# A configuration passthrough component for centralizing Google Vertex AI access.
#
# Google Vertex AI provides access to Google's AI models (Gemini, PaLM, etc.)
# via a project-scoped API. This component centralizes the project and location
# settings so dependent applications can:
#   - Access project/location via dependencies.<name>.outputs.<field>
#   - Share consistent Vertex AI configuration across the environment
#
# Note: Authentication is typically handled via workload identity or service
# account keys mounted separately. This component manages the project-level config.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Deploy this component once per environment
#   2. Have your applications depend on it
#   3. Access values via ${{ dependencies.google-vertex.outputs.project_id }}

variables:
  project_id:
    description: "Google Cloud project ID containing the Vertex AI resources"
    required: true

  location:
    description: "Google Cloud region for Vertex AI (e.g., us-central1, europe-west4)"
    default: "us-central1"

# Outputs expose values to dependent components
# Access via: ${{ dependencies.google-vertex.outputs.<name> }}
outputs:
  project_id:
    description: "Google Cloud project ID for Vertex AI"
    value: ${{ variables.project_id }}

  location:
    description: "Google Cloud region for Vertex AI"
    value: ${{ variables.location }}

# This component doesn't deploy any infrastructure.
# It serves as a configuration hub for Vertex AI settings across your environment.
