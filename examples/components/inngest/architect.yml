# Example: Inngest Background Jobs Configuration
# A configuration passthrough component for centralizing Inngest event-driven job settings.
#
# Inngest is a platform for building reliable background jobs and workflows.
# This component centralizes Inngest credentials so dependent applications can:
#   - Access event and signing keys via dependencies.<name>.outputs.<field>
#   - Share consistent job configuration across the environment
#
# Usage:
#   1. Deploy this component once per environment
#   2. Have your applications depend on it
#   3. Access values via ${{ dependencies.inngest.outputs.event_key }}

variables:
  event_key:
    description: "Inngest event key for sending events"

  signing_key:
    description: "Inngest signing key for verifying webhook payloads"
    required: true
    sensitive: true

# Outputs expose values to dependent components
# Access via: ${{ dependencies.inngest.outputs.<name> }}

# This component doesn't deploy any infrastructure.
# It serves as a configuration hub for Inngest settings across your environment.
