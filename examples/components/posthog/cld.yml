# Example: PostHog Product Analytics Configuration
# A configuration passthrough component for centralizing PostHog settings.
#
# PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform (also offered as SaaS).
# This component centralizes PostHog configuration so dependent applications can:
#   - Access project keys and settings via dependencies.<name>.outputs.<field>
#   - Share consistent analytics configuration across the environment
#
# Usage:
#   1. Deploy this component once per environment
#   2. Have your applications depend on it
#   3. Access values via ${{ dependencies.posthog.outputs.key }}

variables:
  key:
    description: "PostHog project API key (phc_...)"
    required: true

  debug:
    description: "Enable PostHog debug mode (logs events to console)"
    default: "false"

  # Optional: Self-hosted configuration
  host:
    description: "PostHog API host (default: https://us.i.posthog.com)"
    default: "https://us.i.posthog.com"

# Outputs expose values to dependent components
# Access via: ${{ dependencies.posthog.outputs.<name> }}
outputs:
  key:
    description: "PostHog project API key"
    value: ${{ variables.key }}

  debug:
    description: "PostHog debug mode flag"
    value: ${{ variables.debug }}

  host:
    description: "PostHog API host"
    value: ${{ variables.host }}

# This component doesn't deploy any infrastructure.
# It serves as a configuration hub for PostHog settings across your environment.
