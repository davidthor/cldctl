# Example: Loops Email Marketing Configuration
# A configuration passthrough component for centralizing Loops.so settings.
#
# Loops is an email marketing platform for SaaS companies.
# This component centralizes Loops credentials so dependent applications can:
#   - Access the API key via dependencies.<name>.outputs.api_key
#   - Share consistent email marketing configuration across the environment
#
# Usage:
#   1. Deploy this component once per environment
#   2. Have your applications depend on it
#   3. Access values via ${{ dependencies.loops.outputs.api_key }}

variables:
  api_key:
    description: "Loops API key"
    required: true
    sensitive: true

# Outputs expose values to dependent components
# Access via: ${{ dependencies.loops.outputs.<name> }}
outputs:
  api_key:
    description: "Loops API key for email marketing"
    value: ${{ variables.api_key }}
    sensitive: true
