description: "Visualize how a datacenter template maps component resources to infrastructure modules"
---

import { OperatorPlayground } from "/snippets/playground-operator.jsx";

Paste a **datacenter template** (HCL) alongside a **component** or **environment** YAML
and click **Visualize Infrastructure** to see which infrastructure modules each resource
would trigger. Everything runs locally in your browser via WebAssembly — no server required.

<Tip>
  The left panel defines your datacenter hooks and variables. The right panel defines
  the application resources. The output shows a two-layer graph: application resources
  on top, infrastructure modules below, with edges showing the mapping.
