import { DeveloperPlayground } from "/snippets/playground-developer.jsx";

Paste a **component** or **environment** YAML below and click **Visualize** to see the
resource dependency graph that cldctl would create. No server required — everything
runs locally in your browser via WebAssembly.

<Tip>
  In **Environment** mode, provide each component's YAML inline. Path-based
  component references are not supported in the playground.
