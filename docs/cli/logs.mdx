# arcctl logs

View and stream logs from workloads in a deployed environment.

Logs are retrieved from the OTel backend provisioned by the datacenter's observability hook. Components must have observability enabled and the datacenter must provide an observability hook with `query_type` and `query_endpoint` outputs.

## Synopsis

```bash
arcctl logs [component[/type[/name]]] -e <environment> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `component` | (Optional) Filter to a specific component |
| `type` | (Optional) Filter by resource type: `deployment`, `function`, `database`, etc. |
| `name` | (Optional) Filter to a specific resource by name |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <name>` | Target environment (required) |
| `-d, --datacenter <name>` | Target datacenter (resolved from flag, `ARCCTL_DATACENTER` env var, or CLI config default) |
| `-f, --follow` | Stream logs in real-time |
| `-n, --tail <count>` | Number of recent lines to show (default: 100) |
| `--since <duration>` | Show logs since a duration (e.g., `5m`, `1h`, `24h`) |
| `--timestamps` | Show timestamps on each line |
| `--no-color` | Disable color output |
| `--backend <type>` | State backend type |
| `--backend-config <key=value>` | Backend configuration |

## Scoping

Logs can be scoped at different levels using the hierarchical `component/type/name` format:

```bash
# All logs in the environment
arcctl logs -e staging

# All logs from one component
arcctl logs -e staging my-app

# All deployment logs in a component
arcctl logs -e staging my-app/deployment

# Logs from a specific deployment
arcctl logs -e staging my-app/deployment/api

# Logs from a specific database
arcctl logs -e staging my-app/database/main
```

## Streaming

Use `-f` to follow logs in real-time:

```bash
# Stream all logs
arcctl logs -e staging -f

# Stream one component
arcctl logs -e staging my-app -f

# Stream a specific workload
arcctl logs -e staging my-app/deployment/api -f
```

## Filtering

```bash
# Logs from the last 5 minutes
arcctl logs -e staging --since 5m

# Last 50 lines
arcctl logs -e staging -n 50

# Last hour, with timestamps
arcctl logs -e staging --since 1h --timestamps
```

## Prerequisites

1. The component must declare `observability: true` (or an `observability` block) in `architect.yml`
2. The datacenter must provide an `observability` hook with `query_type` and `query_endpoint` outputs
3. The environment must be deployed and the observability resource must be ready

If observability is not configured, the command will instruct you to enable it.

<Note>
Container stdout is automatically forwarded to the OTel collector via the Docker fluentd logging driver in the local Docker datacenter, so even applications without OTel SDK instrumentation have queryable logs.
