# arcctl inspect

Inspect deployed state by providing a slash-separated path, or visualize a component's topology.

## State Inspection

```bash
arcctl inspect <environment>                          # Show environment details
arcctl inspect <environment>/<component>              # Show component details
arcctl inspect <environment>/<component>/<resource>   # Show resource details
```

Drill into deployed state at any level — environment, component, or individual resource.
This is especially useful for debugging to see exactly what environment variables, inputs,
and outputs a deployment or function received after expression resolution.

### Inspect an Environment

```bash
arcctl inspect staging
```

Shows environment status, variables, a table of deployed components, and any route URLs.

**Example output:**

```
Environment: staging
Datacenter:  my-dc
Status:      ready
Created:     2026-01-15 10:00:00
Updated:     2026-01-16 14:30:00

Components:
  NAME                 SOURCE                                   STATUS       RESOURCES
  my-app               ghcr.io/org/my-app:v1                    ready        4
  shared-db            ghcr.io/org/shared-db:v1                 ready        2

URLs:
  my-app/main: https://my-app.example.com
```

### Inspect a Component

```bash
arcctl inspect staging/my-app
```

Shows component metadata, variables, dependencies, and a table of all resources
with their type, status, and summary details.

**Example output:**

```
Component:   my-app
Environment: staging
Datacenter:  my-dc
Source:      ghcr.io/org/my-app:v1
Status:      ready
Deployed:    2026-01-15 10:30:00

Resources:
  TYPE             NAME                 STATUS       DETAILS
  database         main                 ready
  deployment       api                  ready
  route            main                 ready        https://my-app.example.com
  service          api                  ready        api.internal:8080
```

### Inspect a Resource

```bash
arcctl inspect staging/my-app/api
```

Shows full resource details including inputs, resolved environment variables, and outputs.
This is the best way to verify what configuration a deployment or function actually received.

**Example output:**

```
Resource:    api
Type:        deployment
Component:   my-app
Environment: staging
Datacenter:  my-dc
Status:      ready
Hook:        deployment
Module:      ecs-service
Created:     2026-01-15 10:30:00
Updated:     2026-01-16 14:30:00

Inputs:
  image:                     123456.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:abc123
  cpu:                       512m
  memory:                    1024Mi

Environment Variables:
  DATABASE_URL               = postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db
  NODE_ENV                   = production
  PORT                       = 8080
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = http://otel-collector:4318

Outputs:
  id:                        arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456:service/my-app-api
```

### Disambiguating Resources

If two resources share the same name but have different types (e.g., a `deployment`
and a `service` both named `api`), qualify the resource with its type:

```bash
arcctl inspect staging/my-app/deployment/api
arcctl inspect staging/my-app/service/api
```

## Component Topology

To visualize a component's resource graph (without deployed state), use the `component` subcommand:

```bash
arcctl inspect component ./my-app
arcctl inspect component ghcr.io/myorg/app:v1
arcctl inspect component ./my-app --expand   # Include dependency graphs
```

## Flags

| Flag | Shorthand | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `--datacenter` | `-d` | Target datacenter (uses default if not set) |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output format: `table` (default), `json`, `yaml` |
| `--backend` | | State backend type |
| `--backend-config` | | Backend configuration (`key=value`, repeatable) |

## JSON/YAML Output

Use `-o json` or `-o yaml` for machine-readable output, useful for scripting:

```bash
# Get resource env vars as JSON
arcctl inspect staging/my-app/api -o json | jq '.inputs.environment'

# Get all component resources as YAML
arcctl inspect staging/my-app -o yaml
```

## Examples

```bash
# Inspect environment in default datacenter
arcctl inspect production

# Inspect component in a specific datacenter
arcctl inspect staging/my-app -d my-dc

# Inspect a function's configuration
arcctl inspect production/frontend/web

# Check what env vars a deployment received
arcctl inspect staging/my-app/api -o json | jq '.inputs.environment'

# Disambiguate resources with same name
arcctl inspect staging/my-app/deployment/api
```
