# arcctl images

List all component and datacenter artifacts in the local cache.

This is similar to `docker images` — it shows every artifact that has been
built locally or pulled from a remote registry.

## Synopsis

```bash
arcctl images [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--type <type>` | Filter by artifact type: `component` or `datacenter` |
| `-o, --output <format>` | Output format: `table` (default), `json`, `yaml` |

## Description

The local artifact cache stores metadata about artifacts that have been:

- **Built locally** using `arcctl build component` or `arcctl build datacenter`
- **Pulled manually** using `arcctl pull component` or `arcctl pull datacenter`
- **Pulled implicitly** during deploy operations when the engine resolves an OCI reference

The cache is stored at `~/.arcctl/registry/artifacts.json` with artifact content
cached at `~/.arcctl/cache/artifacts/`.

When a build command is run without the `-t` flag, the artifact is identified by
its content digest (similar to `docker build` without `-t`). These entries appear
with `<none>` for both REPOSITORY and TAG.

## Examples

```bash
# List all cached artifacts
arcctl images

# List only components
arcctl images --type component

# List only datacenters
arcctl images --type datacenter

# JSON output (for scripting)
arcctl images -o json

# YAML output
arcctl images -o yaml
```

## Output

```
$ arcctl images

```

### Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `REPOSITORY` | Repository portion of the artifact reference (or `<none>` for untagged builds) |
| `TAG` | Tag portion (or `<none>` for untagged builds) |
| `ARTIFACT ID` | Short content digest (first 12 hex characters) |
| `TYPE` | `component` or `datacenter` |
| `SOURCE` | `built` (locally) or `pulled` (from remote registry) |
| `SIZE` | Artifact size in human-readable format |
| `CREATED` | Relative time since the artifact was added |
