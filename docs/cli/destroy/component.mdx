# arcctl destroy component

Destroy a deployed component and all of its resources.

<Note>
Use `arcctl destroy comp` as shorthand for `arcctl destroy component`.
</Note>

## Synopsis

```bash
arcctl destroy component <name> -e <environment> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Name of the component to destroy |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <name>` | Target environment (required) |
| `-d, --datacenter <name>` | Target datacenter (resolved from flag, `ARCCTL_DATACENTER` env var, or CLI config default) |
| `--auto-approve` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--force` | Force destroy even if other components depend on this one |
| `--backend <type>` | State backend type |
| `--backend-config <key=value>` | Backend configuration |

## Dependency Protection

If other components in the environment depend on the component being destroyed, the command will fail with an error listing the dependents:

```
Error: cannot destroy component "shared-db" because the following components
depend on it: api, frontend
Destroy those components first, or use --force to override
```

Use `--force` to override this check when you know what you're doing (e.g., the dependents are already broken or will be redeployed).

## Examples

```bash
# Destroy a component
arcctl destroy component my-app -e production

# Using alias
arcctl destroy comp my-app -e production

# Auto-approve (CI/CD)
arcctl destroy component my-app -e staging --auto-approve

# Force destroy a component that has dependents
arcctl destroy component shared-db -e staging --force
```

## Output

```
$ arcctl destroy component web-app -e staging

Component:   web-app
Environment: staging

The following resources will be destroyed:

  - deployment "api" (ready)
  - service "api" (ready)
  - database "main" (ready)
  - route "main" (ready)

Total: 4 resources to destroy
