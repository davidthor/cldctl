# cldctl rollout promote

Promote a named instance, destroying all other instances and collapsing the component back to single-instance mode. This is the final cleanup step after a successful progressive rollout.

The promoted instance's source becomes the component's canonical source, its per-instance resources are moved to shared resources, and the Instances map is removed from state.

## Usage

```bash
cldctl rollout promote <component> -e <environment> --instance <name> [flags]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `component` | Name of the component |

## Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--environment` | `-e` | Target environment (required) |
| `--datacenter` | `-d` | Target datacenter |
| `--instance` | | Instance to promote (required) |

## Examples

```bash
# Promote canary to be the sole version
cldctl rollout promote my-app -e production --instance canary
```

## What Happens

1. The promoted instance's per-instance resources are moved to component-level shared resources
2. The component's source is updated to the promoted instance's source
3. All other instances and their per-instance resources are marked for cleanup
4. The `Instances` map is removed from component state
5. The component returns to single-instance mode
