# cldctl rollout rollback

Remove a named instance, destroying its per-instance resources and redistributing its traffic weight to remaining instances. If only one instance remains after removal, the component collapses back to single-instance mode.

## Usage

```bash
cldctl rollout rollback <component> -e <environment> --instance <name> [flags]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `component` | Name of the component |

## Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--environment` | `-e` | Target environment (required) |
| `--datacenter` | `-d` | Target datacenter |
| `--instance` | | Instance to remove (required) |

## Examples

```bash
# Roll back the canary instance
cldctl rollout rollback my-app -e production --instance canary
```

## What Happens

1. The specified instance is removed from state
2. Its traffic weight is redistributed proportionally to remaining instances
3. If only one instance remains, the component collapses to single-instance mode
4. Per-instance resources for the removed instance are destroyed
